<h1>A1- Interactive media</h1>
<h2>HUANG JENNIFER</h2>
<h3>Reflection of Liquid Entropy</h3>
<br><br>

<h4>
  1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
  <br>
With the keeping note of visual hierarchy, controls I went to first <br>and any drawing aspects to the piece, I was keenly aware how much space the artwork occupied. <br>The initial words such as: bold, striking, mysterious and alluring was what I I noted down. 
<br>I knew the message and call of action was clear to me, and was interested that it did not start with a 'start' or 'welcome' button, <br>I was welcomed to discover and interact with it as I wished. 

<br><br>
2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.

<br>
-take note of the actions/how you first interacted with the website:
<br>

-the main interactive artwork (central image on the page)
<br>

-hovered my mouse around the interactive artwork to discover what gestures worked
<br>

-used the mousepad gestures to zoom in and out noticing the menu bar resides 
<br>
-used the arrow keys to test the artwork
<br>
-clicking through the tabs (looked up at the menu bar)
<br>
-hovered over the tabs and looked at the icons from left to right
<br>
-selected a tab that interested me
<br>
-eyes went to the control sidebar to explore the interaction
<br>
-turned up the volume bar on my laptop to get the most of the artworks
<br>
-turned on the brightness on my laptop to see every detail 
<br>
-clicking frantically through each interactive artwork 
<br>
-pulled out my phone to record the works and posted it on instagram story
<br>
<br>
3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
<br>
I initially I was drawn to the instant control and ability to unsettle the digital space. <br>I personally enjoyed the tactile function it presumed to give me. <br>The hover and arrow function was what I used predominantly, <br>it gave the most and instant results and I personally enjoyed watching the metallic liquid move, flow and settle. 
<br><br>
4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
<br>
Due to how visually strong the artwork is, I found the most response element; the mouse was what I went to again and again. <br>Playing with the control panel on the side made it an enjoyable self directed experience.<br> With most desktop based digital artwork, the mouse, and keyboard and usually what controls the universe users are plunged in, <br>so it made sense to go for those options as a point of reference for first contact. 
<br><br>
5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
<br>
My first impression of the interactive experience was enjoy and experiment with the artwork presented. <br>Named liquid entropy, it gave a feeling of mystery, fluidity and a sense of impermanence.<br> I would call this a self directed experience into Ephemeral digital art,<br> the backdrop of a concrete plain becomes entirely obscured by the user's intervention. <br>The use of shimmering metallic, industrial colours and purples made a really striking <br>and thought provoking juxtaposition against the flowing effect that the artwork creates. <br>I have interpreted the interactive experience as an exercise of thought play and fluidity in unlikely spaces. 
<br><br>
6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
<br>
I got the impression of this artwork  was to a mainly self directed experience, one where the user can <br>dictate and explore almost every aspect of the artwork. It wasn't incredibly clear to know the primary goal,<br> without a introduction, directions or a synopsis, but I have come to know that may very well be the point. 
<br><br>
7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
<br>
My general impression of the timeline of this experience is that the interaction with this artwork has no set timeline, expectation or storyline.<br> The interaction over time I discovered and upon reflection should be one of increasing curiosity, <br>boldness, creativity and to follow the change and prompt of destruction if it comes to it.<br> The longer I sat with the artwork, the more I changes settings, <br>zoomed in and out of the screen and tested the confines of the artwork. <br>I believe it was a great opportunity of play and expression,<br> I would suggest an interaction of more than 3 times as an optimum visitation <br>and roughly 3 minutes of less depending how quickly a participant explores all options they wish to change and reset. 
<br><br>
8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
<br>
Over time the interactive experience was an ironic mirror into how our minds wandered, and curiosity changes as we sit with an artwork with such a scope of free-reign. <br>The singular guarantee is over time the screen when left undisturbed the metallic fluid would settle, <br>my general impression at the end was to create and explore this chaos and allowing it to deescalate, which I found quite satisfying to see settle. 
<br><br>
9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?

Other point of references that I noted was the background image; a physical concrete space. <br>The industrial setting most likely captured or cited from a website or personal collection of the artist. 
<br><br>
10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?
<br>
The physical landscape that the background image is uses not only informs a space, or feeling being amongst a setting such as a deserted concrete building.<br> It informs a point in place to exercise the level of digital and image disruption, without an image behind the visual effects,<br> it would feel like satisfying to see the mirrors morph, change and disrupted.<br> Images and places that we can recognise and picture ourselves in creates an immersive experience in itself as we recall associations or memories of construction buildings. <br>By harbouring our own thoughts on this backdrop it can tap into a creative and nostalgic space in mind. 
How a user may engage in this, depends on the user itself the backdrop is quite neutral and universally known. The way the user likes to disturb this image and create motion is how I would go about it. 
<br><br>
11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?
<br>
Personally this reference suggests that fluidity can be found in grey spaces. <br>The backdrop was quite a symbolic to me, as cold, industrial, capitalistic, claustrophobic environment, <br>with the visual ability to manipulate in such a vast way was very engaging to me. <br>The act of destruction, disturbance, repair, diffusion and stillness were opposing forces that I enjoyed watch and react to. 
<br><br>
12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?
<br>
The most frustrating element of the interaction if that it wasn't fully immersive.<br> I wanted to move around the map and explore what was behind and navigate around the space. <br>I wanted to interact with the artwork more, however I could not connect with the environment enough to exceed a 3 minute interaction. <br>I also struggled with the limited palette I could choose, I enjoy the palette of greys, <br>white and purple but wondered how I would feel and engage if I were to change the colours to red or pink. <br>The idea of fluidity would be so lively with the addition of a fuller spectrum of colour. 
<br><br>
13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?
<br>
The most satisfying element to me was the reset options, to reign in the chaos.<br> Watching the ripples settle was a satisfying way to see it fall, settle back to the original mode of stillness. <br>I felt in many ways it could represent the clouded minded with motion and never ending thoughts,<br> the stillness was what I enjoyed to see. The experience allowed me to reflect on my own likes and ways of interacting with artwork,<br> it was responsive to my actions and allowed to me think introspectively if I was projecting any thoughts and needs at the time.
