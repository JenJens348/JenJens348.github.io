  <!--Alongside the interaction your web page should include an explanation discussing your specific design decisions, 
    citing sources where appropriate. You can include additional elements on the page but your focus should be on creating a central interaction 
    that demonstrates a clear relationship to your chosen adjective/principle pairing.
  

    The pairing that I choose was translucent and information. To achieve the goal of creating an interactive digital word jumble/found poetry piece.  
I wanted to create an expressive format of information and communication. Pairing a translucent quality and theory of impermeable and impermanence was the main creative direction of this interactive artwork. 

By using the translucent abstract adjective, the opaque quality achieved with an opaque filter in the CSS styling and intentional colour palette hints to the user that there is more information available and hidden underneath. 
In combination with a javascript code of disappearing elements initiated with an 'onclick' event., achieves the feeling of an impermanent digital space. An intentional art piece that encourages un-functional, deconstructive, and creative thinking. 

This technique is called 'Found Poetry', a common creative exercise used by writers, creatives, and poets.

Additionally, I have included the poem twice on the website, the second time it appears in three sentences, hidden within the square elements that the user may discover as they click and peel away the layers of squares. Much like a choose-your-own-adventure.

 The website does include a link to the poem within the description, as well as a brief explanation of the premise of Found Poetry. Furthermore, this contextualise the creative exercise, so hopefully, any user can interact with it meaningfully.
